# Public-API-Requests
Public API Requests  Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself.  This project uses the Random Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random employees and uses that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.
